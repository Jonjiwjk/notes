# Introduction
- ## Computer
  - A computer is a machine that processes data following a sequence of instructions
  - For work, computers are good at performing
    - repetitive and boring operations such as doing calculations or formatting texts
    - complex and fast operations such as machinery control or management of information systems
  - Programs are sequences of instructions executed by the computer decisions made by the computer to perform a certain activity
  -
