# Foundations of Computer Science Week 1

# Introduction
- ## Computer
  - A computer is a machine that processes data following a sequence of instructions
  - For work, computers are good at performing
    - repetitive and boring operations such as doing calculations or formatting texts
    - complex and fast operations such as machinery control or management of information systems
  - Programs are sequences of instructions executed by the computer decisions made by the computer to perform a certain activity
  - 
- ## Programming
  - A program describes with great detail to the computer the sequence of steps required to perform a specific task The activity to design and implement a program is referred to as Programming
  - Programming is an important part of computing
- ## Algorithms
  - An algorithm is the description of a method for solving a problem that consists of a finite sequence of executable steps comes to a conclusion with a finite number of steps.
  - A computer can only solve problems for which an algorithm is known
  - The identification of an algorithm is a prerequisite for solving a problem (with or without a computer).
  - Writing a program to solve a problem usually involves translating an algorithm into some programming language.
  - Before writing a program, it is necessary to identify and describe an algorithm!
# Computer Architecture
- ## Von Neumann's Model
  - 1945-46 John Von Neumann develops theoretical model of an architecture still widely used
  - Most of current computers have an architecture that can be traced back to Von Neumann's
  - Original Von Neumann's Model :
